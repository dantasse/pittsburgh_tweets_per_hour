Map of tweets in Pittsburgh over the last year. 

To run this: run ./main.py, then go to localhost:5000 in a browser.

To get some data, fill in the Radius, Hour (0-23), and Maximum boxes. 15 for
radius and 500-700 for maximum seems to work pretty well.

Screengrab it like so in a terminal:
screencapture -R100,100,500,500 ~/Desktop/screen.png
Those parameters are x, y, width, height.

Props to http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X for telling
me about the screencapture command-line tool. Awesome.
